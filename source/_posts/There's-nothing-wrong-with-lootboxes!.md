#  There's nothing wrong with lootboxes!

Lootboxes have been in the news a lot recently, with a number of governments looking into whether they should be regulated. Some people see lootboxes as a form of gambling, and feel that they should be banned. But I think there's nothing wrong with lootboxes - in fact, I think they can be a lot of fun!

There's no doubt that lootboxes can be addictive - but so can many other things, including video games themselves! I don't think it's fair to blame lootboxes for addiction when there are so many other factors at play.

Lootboxes can also be a great way to get new items and cosmetics in games. Many games now offer seasonal events or challenges that give you the chance to get new items as rewards. This can add a lot of replay value to games, and keep players coming back for more.

I also think lootboxes can be a good way to introduce players to new games. If you're not sure whether you want to buy a game, you can try out its "free" version by opening some lootboxes. This can help you decide whether the game is worth buying or not.

Overall, I think lootboxes are a perfectly fine way to enjoy video games. They may not be for everyone, but I don't see anything wrong with them.

#  Lootboxes are definitely not gambling

As the popularity of lootboxes continues to grow, so too does the debate around whether or not they constitute gambling. In this article, I will argue that lootboxes are not gambling, for a variety of reasons.

First and foremost, lootboxes are not games of chance. The player always has some degree of control over the outcome of the game, as they must choose which items to keep and which to discard. This is in stark contrast to gambling games like roulette or blackjack, where the player has no control over the outcome.

Second, lootboxes do not rely on any element of luck. The player knows exactly what they are getting every time they open a box, unlike in gambling where the odds are never in favour of the player.

Lastly, there is no real-world currency involved in lootboxes. Players cannot lose money by playing them, unlike in gambling where players can easily lose large sums of money if they’re not careful.

In conclusion, it is clear that lootboxes are not gambling. They may be controversial and unpopular with some people, but that does not mean they should be classified as a form of gambling.

#  You can't call lootboxes gambling because there's no real money involved

The definition of gambling is "to bet on an outcome, especially in a game of chance." This is not what happens with lootboxes. There is no money placed on the line, so it's not gambling.

You could argue that dopamine is involved in both activities, but that doesn't make them the same thing. Dopamine is released when we experience pleasure, and it can be triggered by many different things - including gambling and lootboxes. But just because something releases dopamine doesn't mean it's the same as gambling.

You could also argue that spending money on lootboxes is a waste, but that's up to the individual. There's no guarantee that you'll get anything good from a lootbox, so it's possible to spend money without getting anything in return. This isn't unique to lootboxes - gambling can also result in losses.

So, while some people may view spending money on lootboxes as a waste, that doesn't mean they're equivalent to gambling.

#  Lootboxes don't count as gambling because you always get something in return

Lootboxes are often viewed as a form of gambling, but this is not really the case. The defining factor of gambling is that you put something in, with the hope of getting something back out that is more valuable than what you put in. With lootboxes, you always get something back, even if it's not the thing you were hoping for.

This isn't to say that lootboxes are without their problems – they can be used in a predatory way to extract more money from players, for example. But they are not technically gambling, and therefore should not be banned or regulated as such.

#  Lootboxes aren't gambling, they're just another way to get cosmetics in games!

Lootboxes have been in the gaming news a lot lately, with people on both sides of the argument having a lot to say. Some say that lootboxes are a form of gambling, and should be regulated as such, while others say that they're just another way to get cosmetics in games, and regulation isn't necessary. So, which is it? Are lootboxes gambling or not?

The thing that's important to understand about lootboxes is that they're not actually gambling. Gambling requires three things: consideration (something of value being put forward), chance (the outcome of an event being random), and eventuality (the result of the chance must have some impact on the consideration). Lootboxes don't meet any of these requirements.

Consideration is easily disproven - all you need to do is spend $0 on a lootbox and you get the same rewards as somebody who spends $100. There's no difference in what you get for your money. Chance is also nonexistent - all lootbox rewards are predetermined, so there's no element of randomness. And finally, eventuality - the only thing that happens as a result of opening a lootbox is that you get some virtual items. There's no real-world impact whatsoever.

So if lootboxes aren't gambling, then what are they? They're simply another way to get cosmetics in games. Developers use them as a way to make money beyond just charging for the game itself, and players use them as a way to get cool-looking gear without having to grind for it. There's nothing wrong with that - after all, cosmetics are purely optional and don't affect gameplay at all.

Some people might argue that because there's always the chance of getting something bad from a lootbox, it meets the definition of gambling. But again, this falls flat when you look at what actually constitutes gambling. Getting something bad from a lootbox doesn't meet any of the requirements - there's no consideration (you didn't spend anything on it), no chance (it was predetermined), and no eventuality (nothing happens as a result).

In conclusion, lootboxes may be frustrating because you never know what you're going to get, but they're not gambling and don't need to be regulated as such. They're simply another way for developers to make money and players to get cosmetics without grinding for them. Thank you for reading!
