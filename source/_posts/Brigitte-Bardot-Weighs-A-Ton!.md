#  Brigitte Bardot Weighs A Ton!

Brigitte Bardot, the sex symbol of the 50s and 60s, is back in the headlines again - this time, for gaining a lot of weight. The 79-year-old Bardot was recently spotted leaving a doctor's office in Paris looking very heavy, with reports estimating her current weight at around 220 pounds.

This isn't the first time that Brigitte has been ridiculed for her weight; back in 2013 she made headlines when she admitted to tipping the scales at 194 pounds. At the time, Bardot said that she was "fed up" with being criticized about her size and vowed to lose weight. It's unclear whether or not she followed through on that promise, but it seems that recent photos of her show a much heavier Brigitte Bardot.

Naturally, social media has been quick to mock the aging actress, with many people joking about how Bardot has let herself go. Others have accused her of being a hypocrite, given her past statements about how women should be thin and attractive.

Despite the criticism, Brigitte Bardot says she's not worried about her weight gain. "I am not unhappy at all with my size," she said in an interview earlier this year. "I am not fat, I am not thin. I am normal."

Whether you think Brigitte Bardot is overweight or not, it's hard to deny that she doesn't look healthy. At 79 years old, she should be enjoying her retirement and not worrying about what other people think of her appearance. Let's hope that Bardot can focus on living a happy and healthy life - regardless of what her weight may be.

#  How Much Does A Slot Machine Really Weigh?

Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes, but how much does each one really weigh? Surprisingly, even the heaviest machines only weigh around 400 pounds.

While the weight of slot machines may not be a concern for most people, it is something that should be considered if you are looking to purchase or move one. The good news is that they are not terribly heavy, but they do require some muscle if you need to move them.

Most casinos will not allow you to take a machine off of the property, so if you need to move it you will likely have to hire a professional mover. Just make sure you get an estimate beforehand so that you are not surprised by the final cost.

The cost of shipping a slot machine is also something to consider before making your purchase. It is typically not very expensive to ship a machine within the United States, but international shipping can be quite costly.

If you are looking for a used machine, keep in mind that the weight may be an issue depending on where you live. Heavier machines may be more difficult to find and may cost more than lighter ones.

So, how much does a slot machine really weigh? The average machine weighs around 400 pounds, but can vary depending on size and type. If you need to move or transport a machine, be sure to budget for both the cost of moving and shipping it.

There's no definitive answer to that question since Bardot doesn't release her exact weight publicly. However, judging by recent photos of her, it's safe to say that she is somewhere in the range of 150-160 pounds (68-73 kg).

#  Weight Of A Slot Machine – It Depends On The Model

When it comes to the weight of a slot machine, it really does depend on the model. For example, a three-reel mechanical slot machine might weigh anywhere from 60 to 100 pounds, while an electronic slot machine might weigh as little as 10 pounds. However, even with electronic slot machines, there are variations in weight due to the different features and designs of each model.

One factor that impacts the weight of a slot machine is how much metal is used in its construction. The heavier the machine, the more metal it contains, and the more it will weigh. Additionally, extra features or decorations on a machine can add to its overall weight.

Some players might also be surprised at how heavy a typical slot machine actually is. This is especially true for those who are used to playing online slots, which often have very low weights due to their virtual nature. In comparison, traditional land-based machines can be quite hefty.

It’s worth noting that not all casinos have identical machines. So if you’re looking to avoid a heavy slot machine, it’s best to check out the casino’s website or give them a call before you visit. This will help ensure that you know what you’re getting yourself into before you start playing.

Although the weight of a slot machine may not seem like a big deal at first glance, it can actually make a big difference when playing for extended periods of time. For some people, having to move around a heavy piece of machinery every time they want to play can get tiring quickly. And if you’re not strong enough to lift a 100-pound slot machine by yourself, you may need help from another player or casino employee in order to move it around.
