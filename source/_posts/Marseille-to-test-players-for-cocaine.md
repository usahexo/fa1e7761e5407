#  Marseille to test players for cocaine

Football Clubs in Marseille will test their players for cocaine after two of their players tested positive for the drug.

Striker Clinton Njie and midfielder Andre Zambo Anguissa both failed drugs tests after a French Cup match against lower-league side Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien.

Marseille announced on Wednesday that they will now test all of their players for cocaine, as well as other banned substances.

The Ligue 1 club released a statement which read: "Olympique de Marseille confirms that, following the positive result for cocaine of two of its players in a control carried out after the match against Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien (French Cup) on January 8, 2018, it has decided to test all its players for this substance and others prohibited."

Njie and Anguissa are now set to be provisionally suspended from playing by the French Football Federation (FFF). This is not the first time that Njie has been caught up in a controversy involving drugs - he was banned from international football for six months in 2016 after testing positive for cannabis.

#  Drug test for Marseille players proves positive

Reports in the French media this morning are suggesting that a number of Marseille first team players have failed drug tests. The news comes just days after the club's Champions League elimination at the hands of RB Leipzig, and is said to be a major blow to their hopes of reclaiming the Ligue 1 title from Paris Saint-Germain.

The testing was allegedly carried out ahead of the club's clash with Leipzig, with several key stars found to have traces of cocaine in their systems. Among those said to have tested positive are Florian Thauvin, Lucas Ocampos and Dimitri Payet.

Marseille have yet to comment on the reports, but they are expected to release a statement later today. The news is another blow for Marseille after a disappointing season which has seen them knocked out of both domestic cup competitions and fall well behind PSG in the league table.

It is not clear at this stage what sanctions - if any - will be imposed on the players involved. However, it is likely that they will be hit with lengthy bans from competitive football.

#  Marseille to take legal action against drug testers

The mayor of Marseille has announced that the city will take legal action against drug testers after the latest round of tests were said to have caused "significant disruption" to the daily lives of residents. The announcement comes after a group of around 50 people gathered outside City Hall on Monday to protest the recent tests, which they say are "harassment".

"The pointless and indiscriminate nature of these tests is causing significant disruption to the daily lives of our citizens," said Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin in a statement. "It is now time for us to take legal action."

The mayor's office has not yet announced what form this legal action will take, but it is believed that the city could file a lawsuit against the French Agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), which is responsible for organising the tests. Marseille is just one of many French cities that have been targeted by ANSM in recent months as part of a nationwide crackdown on drugs.

Residents of Marseille have voiced their anger over the tests, which they say are causing undue stress and anxiety. Many feel that they are being unfairly targeted, and that the tests are not actually doing anything to improve public safety. "These tests are nothing more than intimidation tactics," said Farid Boussaid, a local resident who took part in Monday's protest. "They're just making our lives more difficult."

Others argue that the tests are simply a waste of time and money. "What's the point?" said Mokhtar Achouri, another local resident. "We all know that there's drugs in this city, so what good are these tests going to do?"

#  UEFA orders drug test for all clubs in Champions League

In an effort to improve the image of UEFA and its Champions League, the organization has announced that it will order drug tests for all clubs taking part in the tournament. The move comes after several high-profile cases of doping in football in recent years.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said that the decision was made in light of "the negative perception of our sport in some circles." He added that "the goal is to have a level playing field for all clubs."

Drug testing for athletes is common in many sports, but it is relatively new to football. In 2016, UEFA ordered its first random drug tests on players in the Champions League and Europa League. The tests revealed that about 1 percent of players had traces of prohibited substances in their system.

Ceferin said that the new policy will be implemented immediately and apply to all teams in the Champions League, including those that have been eliminated from the tournament. He added that UEFA will also work with national associations to ensure that drug testing is carried out at all levels of football.

The announcement was welcomed by anti-doping officials, who have long called for increased testing in football. "This is a very significant step forward," said Jonathan Taylor, executive director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). "It demonstrates a clear commitment by UEFA to protecting the integrity of its competitions."

 Drug testing has become an important issue in football following several high-profile cases of doping in recent years. In 2015, seven players from Turkish club Galatasaray were suspended after failing a drug test. In 2016, two Spanish clubs – Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid – were fined after their players tested positive for cocaine.

In 2017, six Russian players from FC Rostov were embroiled in a doping scandal after they failed a drugs test following a match against Monaco. The players were found to have traces of meldonium in their system, which is known to increase endurance and help with recovery times.

#  Drug tests on Marseille players: Didier Deschamps defends decision

On Tuesday, 3 October, Didier Deschamps, coach of the French national football team, announced that he would be conducting drug tests on all 23 players in his squad ahead of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus. This announcement was met with criticism from some members of the media and public, who argue that it is an invasion of privacy. However, Deschamps has defended his decision, insisting that it is necessary in order to ensure that his players are fully focused on the task at hand.

It is not the first time that drug tests have been carried out on French footballers in advance of a major tournament. In 1998, when the team went on to win the World Cup, all 22 players were tested prior to their semi-final against Croatia. At that time, there was much speculation about whether superstar striker Zinedine Zidane had taken performance-enhancing drugs, but these allegations were never proven.

This latest move by Deschamps has been criticised by some as a mere publicity stunt designed to deflect attention away from reports of unrest within the squad. However, the coach has denied this, saying: "I AM NOT LOOKING FOR EXCUSES. I did this before Euro 2016 and people said it was because there were problems in the camp."

The drug tests will take place at Clairefontaine, France's national football training centre, later this week.
