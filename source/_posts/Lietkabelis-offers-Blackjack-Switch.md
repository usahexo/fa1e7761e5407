#  Lietkabelis offers Blackjack Switch

Casino Lietkabelis offers Blackjack Switch, a new and innovative blackjack game which promises more excitement and higher payouts. In this game, players are dealt two hands of cards and have the opportunity to switch the second card from one hand to the other. 

This can be a very advantageous move if it improves the strength of one of your hands. For example, if you are dealt an ace and a two as your first two cards, you could switch the two to create an ace and a king. This would give you a better chance of winning than if you kept the two cards separate. 

Blackjack Switch is available at Casino Lietkabelis now, so be sure to check it out!
