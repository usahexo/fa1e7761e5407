#  Are the games fair?

The games that we play today, especially the online ones, seem fair. We can legitimately win and lose depending on our skills. This is only possible because of the technology that we have now.

But are the games really fair? Can someone cheat and win unfairly?

Most of the time, no. The games are designed in a way that it is difficult to cheat. Programs that can give an unfair advantage are usually found and banned by the developers.

However, there have been cases where players have exploited loopholes in the game design to get an edge over their opponents. One famous example is the “Madden 17” coin glitch, which allowed players to exploit the game’s economy and get millions of coins for free.

Nevertheless, most of the time, playing fairly is still the best way to enjoy the game.
