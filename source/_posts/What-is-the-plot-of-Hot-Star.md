#  Is Hot Star a good novel?

Hot Star, by Yangsze Choo, is a historical fiction novel set in 1920s Shanghai. It tells the story of Li Lianying, a eunuch in the imperial court of the last emperor of China, and his journey from servitude to self-discovery.

The Good

First and foremost, I enjoyed Hot Star because it is expertly crafted. The worldbuilding is impeccable; Choo brings 1920s Shanghai to life with exquisite detail. The plot is well-paced and suspenseful, and the characters are rich and multi-dimensional.

Second, I appreciate that Hot Star is not a romance novel. Too often, historical fiction falls into the trap of becoming a love story between a white European man and an East Asian woman. While there are romantic elements in Hot Star, they are not the focus of the story. Rather, Li Lianying’s journey is about self-discovery and overcoming adversity.

The Bad

That said, there were a few things that I didn’t like about Hot Star. First and foremost, I found the beginning to be slow and difficult to get into. It wasn’t until Li Lianying left the imperial court that the story really began to pick up pace. Second, I felt that some parts of the ending were rushed and undeveloped. Finally, I didn’t like how Choo romanticized feudalism and imperialism.

Overall however, I did enjoy reading Hot Star and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent historical fiction novel.
