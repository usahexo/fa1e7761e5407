#  Nevada Gambling Commission Approves Use of Shasta Gaming Holder

_The Nevada gambling commission has given the nod to the use of the Shasta gaming holder by casino operators in the state. The new device, which is made by Shasta Inc., is designed to hold and dispense gaming chips._

The commission's approval came after a six-month trial of the Shasta holder at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Las Vegas. Operators there say that the device has been a success, with players enjoying the convenience of not having to carry around large stacks of chips.

The Shasta gaming holder is a small, handheld unit that can hold up to 200 chips. It has an LCD screen that displays the value of each chip, as well as a touch-screen interface that allows players to select their bets.

Players can also use the holder to store their winnings, making it easy to keep track of how much they've won or lost. The device is rechargeable and comes with a built-in security system that makes it difficult to counterfeit chips.

Shasta Inc. plans to begin marketing the gaming holder to casinos worldwide later this year.

#  Nevada Casinos Adopting New Gaming Holder to Improve Odds for Players

One of the most exciting aspects of playing casino games is the potential to win big. However, for players who are not familiar with the game, the odds of winning can seem overwhelming. Nevada casinos have recognized this challenge and are now adopting new gaming holders to improve the odds for players.

The new gaming holder is a device that attaches to the side of a traditional gaming machine and holds the player’s cards. This allows players to view their cards more easily, which in turn makes it easier for them to make decisions about their next move.

Many experts believe that this simple change will help players improve their odds of winning. In fact, one study showed that players who used the new gaming holder won almost twice as often as those who did not use it.
