# 3. How to Win on Slot Machines at the Casino - As Roma Edition 

In the summer of 2018, AS Roma made a trip to the United States to take on Tottenham Hotspur in a friendly match. The game took place at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. The stadium is located about twenty miles west of Manhattan.

The match was rather uneventful with Roma winning 1-0. However, the real action happened after the game when some of the players decided to go to the casino.

The first thing that one needs to realize about trying to win on slot machines at a casino is that it is extremely difficult - much more difficult than one might think. In order to have any realistic chance of winning, one needs to have a good understanding of the odds involved and also be comfortable with losing quite a bit of money.

That said, there are a few things that can be done in order to tilt the odds somewhat in one's favor: 

1) Choose a machine with good odds: This may not be easy to do, but it is definitely worth doing some research ahead of time in order to find out which machines offer the best chance of winning. Obviously, avoid games with high jackpots as these tend to have very low odds of actually winning anything. 
2) Play maximum bet: This is another way of increasing the chances of winning and can often be done without risking too much money. When playing maximum bet, the player is essentially betting on all possible lines and therefore has a higher chance of hitting something big. 
3) Use slot strategies: There are various slot strategies that can be used in order to improve one's chances but none of them are guaranteed to work 100%. One popular strategy is called "the stars strategy" which involves keeping track of which symbols have already appeared on the reels and then betting accordingly. Other strategies include "the fibonacci system" and "martingale system". 
4) Be patient: This may be the most important piece of advice when it comes to gambling - especially when it comes to playing slots. Often, people get impatient and start betting more money than they can afford in order to try and win back what they have lost. This almost always leads to disaster and should be avoided at all cost!
