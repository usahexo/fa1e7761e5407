#  Roulette Wheel has 38 Sections 

In roulette, a wheel has 38 sections numbered 1-36 plus a 0 and a 00. A ball is spun around the wheel and when it falls into one of the pockets, the corresponding number is announced as the winner.

The odds of any given number coming up are 1 in 38, or 2.63%. The odds of any two particular numbers coming up are 1 in 768 (0.13%). 

There are 18 red numbers and 18 black numbers on the wheel. As well, there are two green zeroes - one on each side of the wheel. This means that players have an equal chance of winning whether they bet on black or red, odd or even, or high (19-36) or low (1-18) numbers. 

The house edge on all bets is 2.7% except for the "La Partage" and "En Prison" rules which lower it to 1.35% and 1.67%, respectively.

The roulette wheel is a gambling game that consists of a spinning wheel with 37 numbered sections and a ball. Players place bets on which number the ball will stop on. 

The wheel has 37 numbered sections corresponding to the numbers 1-36, plus a 0 section. The 0 section is green, while all of the other 36 sections are red or black. A small white ball is spun around the inner rim of the wheel and eventually falls into one of the numbered slots. 

Players can bet on any single number or on a range of numbers by placing their chips on the relevant section of the table layout. The house edge for European roulette is 2.7%. American roulette, which has an extra 00 slot, has a 5.26% house edge.
