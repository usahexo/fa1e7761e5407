#  Over Half of Addictive Gamblers Heal Themselves!

It is no secret that gambling can be addictive. In fact, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling, problem gambling affects about 2 percent of the population in the United States. However, what may come as a surprise is that over half of these people manage to quit or reduce their gambling habit without any formal help.

Naturally, some people are more prone to addiction than others, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to overcoming an addiction. However, there are a few things that can help increase the likelihood of success.

Firstly, it is important to understand and admit that there is a problem. Denial is one of the main reasons why addicts do not seek help, so it is essential to be honest with yourself and accept that you need help.

Secondly, don't be afraid to ask for help! There are many resources available for those who struggle with addiction, from self-help groups to professional counseling. It can be difficult to admit that you need help, but it is worth it in the end.

Thirdly, make a plan. Just like any other goal, overcoming an addiction requires a plan and strategy. Figure out what works for you and stick to it. Make sure your goals are realistic and achievable so you don't get discouraged along the way.

Finally, be patient! Addiction is a powerful force and it will not be easy to overcome overnight. Take things one day at a time and celebrate every victory no matter how small. With time and effort, you can overcome your addiction and live a happier, healthier life.

#  Study Shows That 56% of Addictive Gamblers Heal Themselves

A study published in the journal "Addiction" has found that 56% of addicted gamblers manage to recover without any professional help. This is encouraging news for those struggling with gambling addiction, as it means that there is a good chance of recovery even if no specialized treatment is sought.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Hamburg in Germany. They analyzed survey data from more than 1,200 participants who had struggled with gambling addiction at some point in their lives. The results showed that 56% of those participants had managed to overcome their addiction without any professional help.

why do so many people manage to recover without treatment?

There are likely several factors at work here. First, many people may be able to recover without formal treatment because they don't have a severe gambling addiction. For those with a less severe problem, quitting on their own may be manageable. Additionally, some people may receive informal support from friends or family members, which can help them resist temptation and stay on track.

Finally, it's important to note that not all forms of treatment are effective for everyone. Some people may find that certain types of treatment work well for them, while others may not get the desired results. This is why it's important to explore all your options before deciding on a course of action.
