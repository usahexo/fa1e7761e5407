#  How Does the Supplier Work in Blackjack Chile? 

The supplier in blackjack Chile is the person who deals the cards and oversees the game. In a casino setting, this is usually a job for a casino employee, but in home games it can also be done by a player. The supplier is typically responsible for dealing the cards to all players, overseeing the betting, announcing winners and paying losers, and generally keeping track of the game.

The supplier also has some important housekeeping duties to perform between hands. He or she must shuffle the deck and place it in the shoe, determine when to end the hand, pay out any winning bets, and collect any losing bets. In most cases, the supplier also announces when it's time for a new hand, which signals all players to return their cards to the deck and get ready for the next deal.

#  How Does the Supplier Work in Blackjack?

One of the most important people in a blackjack game is the supplier. They are the ones who deal the cards and keep track of the score. Here’s how they work:

## The Dealer

The dealer is responsible for dealing out the cards and keeping track of the scores. In blackjack, there is one dealer per table. They stand at one end of the table and distribute cards to each player, face down. The dealer also keeps track of how many points each player has, as well as how many points the dealer has.

The dealer starts each round by flipping over one of their own cards - this is called “ exposes ”. The player with the highest point value at this point wins the round. If there is a tie, then it goes to another round. The dealer then collects all cards and deals again for the next round.

## Keeping Score

In blackjack, points are tallied up using a simple scoring system:

Aces = 1 point
 Kings, Queens, Jacks = 10 points 2s through 10s = face value A hand with an ace and any card lower than a six is considered 21 , or Blackjack . This hand beats all other hands except for a Blackjack . A hand with two cards of the same value (e.g., two 2s) is called a Bust . This hand loses to all other hands.
