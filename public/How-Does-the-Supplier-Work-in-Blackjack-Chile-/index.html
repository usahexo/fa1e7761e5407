In a casino setting, this is usually a job for a casino employee, but in home games it can also be done by a player. The supplier is typically responsible for dealing the cards to all players, overseeing the betting, announcing winners and paying losers, and generally keeping track of the game.</p>
<p>The supplier also has some important housekeeping duties to perform between hands. He or she must shuffle the deck and place it in the shoe, determine when to end the hand, pay out any winning bets, and collect any losing bets. In most cases, the supplier also announces when it’s time for a new hand, which signals all players to return their cards to the deck and get ready for the next deal.</p>
