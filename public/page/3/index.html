        <h1 id="There’s-nothing-wrong-with-lootboxes"><a href="#There’s-nothing-wrong-with-lootboxes" class="headerlink" title="There’s nothing wrong with lootboxes!"></a>There’s nothing wrong with lootboxes!</h1><p>Lootboxes have been in the news a lot recently, with a number of governments looking into whether they should be regulated. Some people see lootboxes as a form of gambling, and feel that they should be banned. But I think there’s nothing wrong with lootboxes - in fact, I think they can be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that lootboxes can be addictive - but so can many other things, including video games themselves! I don’t think it’s fair to blame lootboxes for addiction when there are so many other factors at play.</p>
<p>Lootboxes can also be a great way to get new items and cosmetics in games. Many games now offer seasonal events or challenges that give you the chance to get new items as rewards. This can add a lot of replay value to games, and keep players coming back for more.</p>
<p>I also think lootboxes can be a good way to introduce players to new games. If you’re not sure whether you want to buy a game, you can try out its “free” version by opening some lootboxes. This can help you decide whether the game is worth buying or not.</p>
<p>Overall, I think lootboxes are a perfectly fine way to enjoy video games. They may not be for everyone, but I don’t see anything wrong with them.</p>
<h1 id="Lootboxes-are-definitely-not-gambling"><a href="#Lootboxes-are-definitely-not-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Lootboxes are definitely not gambling"></a>Lootboxes are definitely not gambling</h1><p>As the popularity of lootboxes continues to grow, so too does the debate around whether or not they constitute gambling. In this article, I will argue that lootboxes are not gambling, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, lootboxes are not games of chance. The player always has some degree of control over the outcome of the game, as they must choose which items to keep and which to discard. This is in stark contrast to gambling games like roulette or blackjack, where the player has no control over the outcome.</p>
<p>Second, lootboxes do not rely on any element of luck. The player knows exactly what they are getting every time they open a box, unlike in gambling where the odds are never in favour of the player.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is no real-world currency involved in lootboxes. Players cannot lose money by playing them, unlike in gambling where players can easily lose large sums of money if they’re not careful.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is clear that lootboxes are not gambling. They may be controversial and unpopular with some people, but that does not mean they should be classified as a form of gambling.</p>
<h1 id="You-can’t-call-lootboxes-gambling-because-there’s-no-real-money-involved"><a href="#You-can’t-call-lootboxes-gambling-because-there’s-no-real-money-involved" class="headerlink" title="You can’t call lootboxes gambling because there’s no real money involved"></a>You can’t call lootboxes gambling because there’s no real money involved</h1><p>The definition of gambling is “to bet on an outcome, especially in a game of chance.” This is not what happens with lootboxes. There is no money placed on the line, so it’s not gambling.</p>
<p>You could argue that dopamine is involved in both activities, but that doesn’t make them the same thing. Dopamine is released when we experience pleasure, and it can be triggered by many different things - including gambling and lootboxes. But just because something releases dopamine doesn’t mean it’s the same as gambling.</p>
<p>You could also argue that spending money on lootboxes is a waste, but that’s up to the individual. There’s no guarantee that you’ll get anything good from a lootbox, so it’s possible to spend money without getting anything in return. This isn’t unique to lootboxes - gambling can also result in losses.</p>
<p>So, while some people may view spending money on lootboxes as a waste, that doesn’t mean they’re equivalent to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Lootboxes-don’t-count-as-gambling-because-you-always-get-something-in-return"><a href="#Lootboxes-don’t-count-as-gambling-because-you-always-get-something-in-return" class="headerlink" title="Lootboxes don’t count as gambling because you always get something in return"></a>Lootboxes don’t count as gambling because you always get something in return</h1><p>Lootboxes are often viewed as a form of gambling, but this is not really the case. The defining factor of gambling is that you put something in, with the hope of getting something back out that is more valuable than what you put in. With lootboxes, you always get something back, even if it’s not the thing you were hoping for.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that lootboxes are without their problems – they can be used in a predatory way to extract more money from players, for example. But they are not technically gambling, and therefore should not be banned or regulated as such.</p>
<h1 id="Lootboxes-aren’t-gambling-they’re-just-another-way-to-get-cosmetics-in-games"><a href="#Lootboxes-aren’t-gambling-they’re-just-another-way-to-get-cosmetics-in-games" class="headerlink" title="Lootboxes aren’t gambling, they’re just another way to get cosmetics in games!"></a>Lootboxes aren’t gambling, they’re just another way to get cosmetics in games!</h1><p>Lootboxes have been in the gaming news a lot lately, with people on both sides of the argument having a lot to say. Some say that lootboxes are a form of gambling, and should be regulated as such, while others say that they’re just another way to get cosmetics in games, and regulation isn’t necessary. So, which is it? Are lootboxes gambling or not?</p>
<p>The thing that’s important to understand about lootboxes is that they’re not actually gambling. Gambling requires three things: consideration (something of value being put forward), chance (the outcome of an event being random), and eventuality (the result of the chance must have some impact on the consideration). Lootboxes don’t meet any of these requirements.</p>
<p>Consideration is easily disproven - all you need to do is spend $0 on a lootbox and you get the same rewards as somebody who spends $100. There’s no difference in what you get for your money. Chance is also nonexistent - all lootbox rewards are predetermined, so there’s no element of randomness. And finally, eventuality - the only thing that happens as a result of opening a lootbox is that you get some virtual items. There’s no real-world impact whatsoever.</p>
<p>So if lootboxes aren’t gambling, then what are they? They’re simply another way to get cosmetics in games. Developers use them as a way to make money beyond just charging for the game itself, and players use them as a way to get cool-looking gear without having to grind for it. There’s nothing wrong with that - after all, cosmetics are purely optional and don’t affect gameplay at all.</p>
<p>Some people might argue that because there’s always the chance of getting something bad from a lootbox, it meets the definition of gambling. But again, this falls flat when you look at what actually constitutes gambling. Getting something bad from a lootbox doesn’t meet any of the requirements - there’s no consideration (you didn’t spend anything on it), no chance (it was predetermined), and no eventuality (nothing happens as a result).</p>
<p>In conclusion, lootboxes may be frustrating because you never know what you’re going to get, but they’re not gambling and don’t need to be regulated as such. They’re simply another way for developers to make money and players to get cosmetics without grinding for them. Thank you for reading!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="So-Why-Is-I-Taxed-On-Betting-If-I-Have-Losses"><a href="#So-Why-Is-I-Taxed-On-Betting-If-I-Have-Losses" class="headerlink" title="So Why Is I Taxed On Betting If I Have Losses?"></a>So Why Is I Taxed On Betting If I Have Losses?</h1><p>The simple answer to this question is that you are taxed on betting because your losses can be used as a deduction against your other forms of taxable income. This helps to ensure that those with gambling-related income pay their fair share of taxes.</p>
<p>But it’s not just gambling losses that can be used as a deduction; any form of Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions (MIDs) can be used in this way. This includes things like unreimbursed employee expenses, tax preparation fees, and even certain charitable contributions.</p>
<p>However, there are some limitations to how much of your MIDs can be deducted. In most cases, you can only deduct the amount that exceeds 2% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). So if your AGI is $50,000, for example, you can only deduct the amount of your MIDs that exceeds $1,000 (2% of $50,000).</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule, however. For example, if you are self-employed and have unreimbursed employee expenses, then you can deduct all of your MIDs. And if you are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), then you can still deduct all of your MIDs regardless of their size relative to your AGI.</p>
<h1 id="Graham-Greene-Weighs-In-On-Betting-Taxes"><a href="#Graham-Greene-Weighs-In-On-Betting-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Graham Greene Weighs In On Betting Taxes"></a>Graham Greene Weighs In On Betting Taxes</h1><p>When it comes to legalizing gambling and betting, the topic of taxation is always a hot one. What should be the percentage of taxes on winnings? On losses? How should they be collected? What about online gambling or betting?</p>
<p>Graham Greene has some thoughts on the matter. The English author, who was born in 1904 and died in 1991, was considered a master of both the thriller and suspense genres. In a 1969 article for The Sunday Times, Greene weighed in on the topic of betting taxes.</p>
<p>He began by noting that, “There can be no question that gambling is evil,” but he added that this didn’t mean it shouldn’t be taxed. In fact, he felt that betting taxes could be a good way to discourage people from engaging in gambling activities.</p>
<p>He also felt that the tax rate should be high enough to cover the administrative costs of collecting it. Anything less, he believed, would just encourage people to cheat on their taxes.</p>
<p>Greene wasn’t a fan of online gambling or betting, feeling that it was too easy for people to cheat in this format. He did concede, however, that there was no real way to stop it and that any attempt to do so would likely be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In terms of what the tax rate should be, Greene favoured a sliding scale approach: lower tax rates for small winnings and higher rates for larger ones. He also felt that tax refunds should be available for those who lost money while gambling.</p>
<p>Overall, Greene was in favour of legalized gambling and betting as long as it was properly taxed. He felt that doing so could help to control problem gambling while also raising revenue for the government.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Are-Gambling-Losses-Taxable"><a href="#Why-Are-Gambling-Losses-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Gambling Losses Taxable?"></a>Why Are Gambling Losses Taxable?</h1><p>One question that often comes up for taxpayers is whether or not gambling losses are deductible. The answer, unfortunately, is usually no. This is because the IRS classifies gambling as a form of entertainment, and as such, any losses incurred as a result are not tax-deductible.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule, however. If you can show that you incurred the losses in the course of carrying out a trade or business, then you may be able to deduct them. Additionally, if you can prove that your gambling activity was legitimate and not just a hobby, then you may be able to claim some of your losses.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that even if you can’t deduct your losses from your taxable income, they still count towards your total amount of gambling winnings. So if you gamble and end up with a net loss for the year, you won’t have to pay taxes on any of your winnings.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that gambling losses are generally not tax-deductible, with a few exceptions. If you have any questions about whether or not your specific situation qualifies for a deduction, it’s best to speak with an accountant or tax specialist.</p>
<h1 id="Does-The-IRS-Tax-Gambling-Winnings-And-Losses-Differently"><a href="#Does-The-IRS-Tax-Gambling-Winnings-And-Losses-Differently" class="headerlink" title="Does The IRS Tax Gambling Winnings And Losses Differently?"></a>Does The IRS Tax Gambling Winnings And Losses Differently?</h1><p>The IRS taxes gambling winnings and losses differently depending on the type of gambling that is taking place. The IRS requires taxpayers to report all gambling winnings as income on their tax returns. Gambling losses, however, can be deducted as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040, but they are subject to certain limitations.</p>
<p>For most taxpayers, gambling winnings and losses are considered taxable and must be reported as part of their gross income on their tax return. This applies to all types of gambling, including casino games, race tracks, lotteries, and even bingo.</p>
<p>However, there is one exception. Gambling winnings from playing bingo or poker for “personal pleasure” are not taxable. To qualify for this exception, the taxpayer must keep accurate records of the winnings and losses from these activities. In addition, the taxpayer’s net loss from gambling must not be more than $500 during the year.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be deducted as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040. However, they are subject to two limitations. First, they can only be deducted if they exceed 2% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (AGI). Second, they are limited to the amount of gambling income reported on the tax return.</p>
<p>For example, say a taxpayer has $1,000 in gambling income and $1,200 in gambling losses for the year. The taxpayer can only deduct $200 worth of the losses ($1,200 - $1,000), since that is the amountof taxable gambling income reported on the return.</p>
<p>The rules for deducting gambling losses are slightly different when the gambler is engaged in a trade or business related to gambling. In this case, all of the losses incurred during the year can be deducted without having to exceed 2% of AGI or being limited to the amount of gambling income reported on the return.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Deduct-Gambling-Losses-From-Your-Federal-Income-Tax"><a href="#How-To-Deduct-Gambling-Losses-From-Your-Federal-Income-Tax" class="headerlink" title="How To Deduct Gambling Losses From Your Federal Income Tax"></a>How To Deduct Gambling Losses From Your Federal Income Tax</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and lucrative hobby, but it can also lead to tax headaches. Fortunately, the Internal Revenue Service allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. The deduction is taken as an itemized deduction, meaning you must itemize your deductions on Schedule A of your Form 1040 tax return in order to claim it.</p>
<p>To qualify for the deduction, you must be able to document your losses. This generally means maintaining a diary or other written record of your gambling transactions. In addition, your losses must exceed your winnings for the year. For example, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings but also incurred $1,500 in losses, you could deduct $500 of your losses from your income.</p>
<p>There are some important limitations to keep in mind when claiming a gambling loss deduction. First, the deduction is limited to (and cannot exceed) the amount of taxable income generated by your gambling activities. In other words, if you have no other income besides gambling winnings, you cannot deduct any losses. Second, the deduction is only available for personal (not business) gambling activities. Finally, there are specific rules governing how the deduction is calculated for taxpayers who file a joint return.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to claim a gambling loss deduction on your federal tax return, please consult with a qualified tax professional.</p>

The new device, which is made by Shasta Inc., is designed to hold and dispense gaming chips.</em></p>
<p>The commission’s approval came after a six-month trial of the Shasta holder at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Las Vegas. Operators there say that the device has been a success, with players enjoying the convenience of not having to carry around large stacks of chips.</p>
<p>The Shasta gaming holder is a small, handheld unit that can hold up to 200 chips. It has an LCD screen that displays the value of each chip, as well as a touch-screen interface that allows players to select their bets.</p>
<p>Players can also use the holder to store their winnings, making it easy to keep track of how much they’ve won or lost. The device is rechargeable and comes with a built-in security system that makes it difficult to counterfeit chips.</p>
<p>Shasta Inc. plans to begin marketing the gaming holder to casinos worldwide later this year.</p>
<h1 id="First-Casino-to-Use-the-Shasta-Gaming-Holder-Installed-in-Reno"><a href="#First-Casino-to-Use-the-Shasta-Gaming-Holder-Installed-in-Reno" class="headerlink" title="First Casino to Use the Shasta Gaming Holder Installed in Reno"></a>First Casino to Use the Shasta Gaming Holder Installed in Reno</h1><p>The Shasta Gaming Holder, a new device created to improve casino security, was installed this week at the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino in Reno.</p>
<p>The Shasta Gaming Holder is a small, handheld device that scans barcodes on gaming chips and authenticates their value. The device also records the time and date of each scan.</p>
<p>“The installation of the Shasta Gaming Holder is just one more example of our commitment to providing our guests with the safest and most enjoyable gaming experience possible,” said Andy Corkill, President of the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino.</p>
<p>The Shasta Gaming Holder was developed by Wayne Dobson, president of Dobson Technologies LLC. “This is an exciting day for me and for my team as we officially launch our new product,” Dobson said. “We believe the Shasta Gaming Holder will revolutionize casino security and greatly reduce counterfeiting.”</p>
<p>The first casino to use the new holder is the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino in Reno. Additional casinos are expected to begin using the device in the coming weeks.</p>
<h1 id="Shasta-Gaming-Holder-Reduces-Table-Game-House-Edge-by-1"><a href="#Shasta-Gaming-Holder-Reduces-Table-Game-House-Edge-by-1" class="headerlink" title="Shasta Gaming Holder Reduces Table-Game House Edge by 1%"></a>Shasta Gaming Holder Reduces Table-Game House Edge by 1%</h1><p>The Shasta Gaming Holder is a device that attaches to the edge of a gaming table and helps reduce the house edge by 1%. The holder was invented by Jerry Darnell, a casino pit boss from Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>The Shasta Gaming Holder is made from high-grade aluminum and has a non-slip rubberized grip. It is easy to install and can be quickly removed when not in use.</p>
<p>The Shasta Gaming Holder is available for purchase online at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.shastagamingholder.com/">www.shastagamingholder.com</a>.</p>

However, for players who are not familiar with the game, the odds of winning can seem overwhelming. Nevada casinos have recognized this challenge and are now adopting new gaming holders to improve the odds for players.</p>
<p>The new gaming holder is a device that attaches to the side of a traditional gaming machine and holds the player’s cards. This allows players to view their cards more easily, which in turn makes it easier for them to make decisions about their next move.</p>
<p>Many experts believe that this simple change will help players improve their odds of winning. In fact, one study showed that players who used the new gaming holder won almost twice as often as those who did not use it.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Are-Skins-Used-Intended-for-Gambling"><a href="#How-Are-Skins-Used-Intended-for-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How Are Skins Used Intended for Gambling?"></a>How Are Skins Used Intended for Gambling?</h1><p>Skin gambling is a type of online gambling that involves the use of virtual items, also known as skins, from video games. These skins are typically acquired via trade with other players in-game or bought on a skin marketplace. They can then be used as betting tokens on casino-like platforms or directly against other players in matchesmaking games to win more skins. </p>
<p>Skins were first introduced into the world of online gambling in late 2013 by the game developer Valve with their release of the team-based first-person shooter game, “Team Fortress 2”. Through their Steam digital distribution platform, “Team Fortress 2” allowed players to trade any in-game item for another. This included weapons, cosmetics, and skins. In the early days of skin gambling, skins were used as mere placeholders for cash bets. However, as the popularity of skin gambling grew, so did the variety of skin betting games offered. </p>
<p>One of the most popular ways to gamble with skins is through so-called “skins casinos”. Here, players can use skins as currency to bet on casino games such as roulette, blackjack, and slot machines. Some sites even offer live casino games where players can bet against a physical dealer. Another popular way to gamble with skins is through “matchmaking” games. These are 5v5 or 3v3 multiplayer games where the winner takes all the skins from both teams. And finally, there are also betting marketplaces where buyers and sellers can trade skins for cash or other items. </p>
<p>As with any form of gambling, there is always a risk of losing your money when you bet on skins. This has led to problems for some gamers who have become addicted to skin gambling and have lost large sums of money. In an effort to combat this problem, Valve announced in mid-2016 that they would be restricting skin trading to within each player’s own Steam account. This means that gamers can no longer trade their skins for cash or items outside of Steam. While this has been successful in preventing many people from losing money through skin gambling, it has also resulted in a decrease in the overall value of skins on the market. </p>
<p>So what does the future hold for skin gambling? It’s hard to say for sure but it seems likely that it will continue to grow in popularity, especially among younger gamers who are more comfortable with using digital items than traditional forms of currency.</p>
<h1 id="Skins-Used-in-Gambling-How-You-Can-Profit"><a href="#Skins-Used-in-Gambling-How-You-Can-Profit" class="headerlink" title="Skins Used in Gambling: How You Can Profit"></a>Skins Used in Gambling: How You Can Profit</h1><p>There are many different types of gambling skins on the market.

If you’re looking for a quick and easy way to make some money, then selling OPSkins skins is a good option. Just make sure that you find a buyer who is willing to pay a fair price for them.</p>
<p>The last type of gambling skin that we’ll be discussing in this article is TF2 Keys. These keys are not as popular as the other two types of skins, but they still have a decent demand on the market. If you want to sell TF2 Keys, then you need to find a buyer who is looking for them specifically. Try contacting online gaming communities or websites that focus on TF2 content in order to find potential buyers.</p>

By following the tips in this article, you should be able to find buyers who are willing to pay a fair price for the gambling skins that you’re selling.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Skin-Gambling"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Skin-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About Skin Gambling"></a>What You Need to Know About Skin Gambling</h1><p>Skin gambling is a type of gambling that uses virtual items from video games as currency. In skin gambling, players trade in-game items, also known as skins, for cash or other goods. The popularity of skin gambling has been on the rise in recent years as the industry has exploded in size.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of skin gambling. One popular type is “skins betting.” This involves predicting the outcome of real-world events, such as professional sports matches or e-sports tournaments, and then placing a bet using skins. Another common type of skin gambling is “skin trading.” This involves trading skins with other players in order to acquire ones that you want or need. Finally, there is “skin lending.” This is a form of gambling where players borrow skins from others with the intention of giving them back plus interest.</p>
<p>The popularity of skin gambling can be attributed to several factors. First, skins are valuable because they can be used to customize the appearance of characters or weapons in games. This makes them desirable to collectors and players who want to stand out from the crowd. Second, many popular games have built-in microtransactions systems that allow players to buy and sell skins for real-world money. This provides an easy way for gamers to gamble with their belongings without having to leave the game itself. Finally, the absence of regulations in the skin gambling industry has made it easy for operators to set up shop and offer their services to players around the world.</p>
<p>The risks associated with skin gambling are similar to those associated with traditional forms of gambling. First and foremost, there is always the risk of losing money when participating in any form of gambling. Second, some unscrupulous operators may try to scam players by refusing to pay out winnings or by providing fraudulent games. Finally, there is also a risk that children and young adults may be exposed to skin gambling without realizing the risks involved.</p>
<p>Despite these risks, skin gambling continues to grow in popularity due to its convenience and excitement. If you’re thinking about getting involved in skin gambling, it’s important that you educate yourself on the risks involved and only gamble with money that you can afford to lose</p>
<h1 id="The-Risks-of-Using-Skins-for-Gambling"><a href="#The-Risks-of-Using-Skins-for-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Risks of Using Skins for Gambling"></a>The Risks of Using Skins for Gambling</h1><p>There are a few risks that come with using skins for gambling. The first is that you may not be able to get your skins back if you lose. This is because the site may not have a system in place to return skins to players who lose. As such, you may end up losing the skins that you deposited.</p>
<p>Another risk is that gambling sites may not be legitimate. This means that you may not actually be getting paid when you win and could end up losing everything that you put in. Because of this, it’s important to do your research before choosing a gambling site to use.</p>
<p>A final risk is that gambling can be addictive. If you find yourself spending more time than intended on gambling sites, it may be time to step away from them altogether. This can help protect both your wallet and your mental health.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Skins-Really-Used-for-Gambling"><a href="#Are-Skins-Really-Used-for-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Are Skins Really Used for Gambling?"></a>Are Skins Really Used for Gambling?</h1><p>The skins industry has been around for many years, with the first skins being used as a way to trade in video games. However, in more recent years, skins have been used as a way to gamble on esports matches and other gaming content.</p>
<p>Some people believe that skins are only used for gambling and that the industry is nothing more than a way to allow people to gamble on video games. However, there are others who believe that skins can be used for other purposes, such as trading or collecting.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the skin gambling industry is growing rapidly. In fact, according to one report, the skin gambling market was worth an estimated $7.4 billion in 2016. This number is expected to grow even larger in the coming years, as the popularity of esports continues to increase.</p>
<p>Despite the growth of the skin gambling industry, there are still many people who don’t understand how it works. In this article, we will explain what skins are and how they are used in gambling. We will also discuss the pros and cons of skin gambling and provide some tips on how to stay safe when using skins for gambling.</p>
<p>What Are Skins?</p>
<p>Skins are virtual items that can be used in video games. They are generally obtained by opening crates or packs that are available in the game’s store. Skins can be used to change the appearance of a character or weapon in the game.</p>
<p>In recent years, skins have also been used as a way to gamble on esports matches and other gaming content. This type of gambling is known as skins betting or skin trading.</p>
<p>How Is Skin Gambling Used?</p>
<p>Skins betting is similar to regular gambling, except that players use skins instead of money to gamble on games or events. There are several different ways that players can use skins for gambling:</p>
<p>-Depositing skins into a casino site allows players to bet on games like blackjack, roulette, and Crash-Pots.-Using a third party site (such as csgoatse) allows players to bet on esport matches-Exchanging skins for goods or services on specialised sites (such as OPSkins) allows players to gamble on items such as weapon cases or CSGO knives.</p>

        <h1 id="Highest-Gambling-Taxes-in-the-World"><a href="#Highest-Gambling-Taxes-in-the-World" class="headerlink" title="Highest Gambling Taxes in the World"></a>Highest Gambling Taxes in the World</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, nothing is as important as the taxes that are levied on the winnings. Different countries have different rates, and some are much higher than others. Here are the five countries with the highest gambling taxes in the world.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Spain</li>
</ol>
<p>Spain has a gambling tax rate of 25%. This means that any time you win money while gambling in Spain, you will have to give 25% of your winnings to the government. This is one of the lower rates on this list, but it can still add up quickly if you win a lot of money.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Denmark</li>
</ol>
<p>Denmark has a gambling tax rate of 27%. This means that any time you win money while gambling in Denmark, you will have to give 27% of your winnings to the government. This is one of the highest tax rates in Europe, and it can quickly eat into your profits.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>United Kingdom</li>
</ol>
<p>The United Kingdom has a gambling tax rate of 30%. This means that any time you win money while gambling in the United Kingdom, you will have to give 30% of your winnings to the government. This is one of the highest tax rates in the world, and it can quickly reduce your profits.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Sweden</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweden has a gambling tax rate of 50%. This means that any time you win money while gambling in Sweden, you will have to give 50% of your winnings to the government. This is easily one of the highest tax rates in the world, and it can quickly eat into your profits.</p>
<ol>
<li>Italy</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy has a gambling tax rate of 68%. This means that any time you win money while gambling in Italy, you will have to give 68% of your winnings to the government. This is easily one of the highest tax rates in Europe, and it can quickly reduce your profits from gambling</p>
<h1 id="America-has-Highest-Gambling-Taxes"><a href="#America-has-Highest-Gambling-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="America has Highest Gambling Taxes"></a>America has Highest Gambling Taxes</h1><p>Las Vegas is a gambling Mecca. But, if you happen to live in America, there’s a good chance that you’re paying more in taxes on your gambling income than people in other countries.</p>
<p>America has the highest gambling taxes in the world. Gambling income is taxed at a rate of up to 50%, while most other countries tax gambling income at a rate of 15% or less.</p>
<p>The high tax rates in America are likely due to the fact that gambling is considered a sin by many people. The government doesn’t want to encourage people to engage in sin, so it charges them extra taxes for doing so.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to America’s high gambling taxes. Hong Kong and Macau have very high taxes on gambling income, with rates of up to 88%. However, these two jurisdictions are special cases because they are both part of China, which has much higher tax rates than most other countries.</p>
<p>Most other developed countries have lower taxes on gambling income. For example, the United Kingdom taxes gambling income at a rate of just 20%, while Australia taxes it at a rate of only 10%. This makes it difficult for American gamblers to compete with gamblers from other countries.</p>
<p>There are some options available for Americans who want to reduce their gambling taxes. One option is to move overseas and gamble in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Another option is to gamble online, where there are no national borders and you can take advantage of the lower tax rates offered by most countries.</p>
<h1 id="Canadians-Pay-Less-in-Gambling-Taxes"><a href="#Canadians-Pay-Less-in-Gambling-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Canadians Pay Less in Gambling Taxes"></a>Canadians Pay Less in Gambling Taxes</h1><p>While gambling is popular all over the world, different countries have different laws and regulations when it comes to gambling taxes. For Canadians, it turns out that they are paying much less in gambling taxes than people in other countries.</p>
<p>In fact, as a recent study found, Canadian gamblers pay an average of just 2.3% in taxes on their winnings. This is compared to an average of 13.3% for people in other countries. In some cases, people are paying more than three times as much in taxes on their gambling winnings!</p>
<p>So why do Canadians pay so much less in gambling taxes? The reason is actually quite simple – the Canadian government doesn’t tax gambling winnings as income. Other countries, such as the United States, do treat gambling winnings as income, which means that they are taxed at a higher rate.</p>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that Canadians don’t have to pay any taxes on their gambling winnings. Gambling establishments are required to report all winnings to the government, and those who earn more than $10,000 per year from gambling activities must report it as income. But even with these requirements in place, Canadian gamblers still pay much less in taxes than people in other countries.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a place where you can enjoy tax-free gambling wins, Canada is definitely a good option! Just be sure to keep track of your winnings and report them correctly if you exceed the $10,000 threshold.</p>
<h1 id="Britain-levies-Heavy-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Britain-levies-Heavy-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Britain levies Heavy Tax on Gambling Winnings"></a>Britain levies Heavy Tax on Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The British government has announced that it will start levying a heavy tax on gambling winnings starting in the new year. This move is expected to bring in an extra £140 million in revenue for the government.</p>
<p>The tax will be levied at a rate of 15% on all winnings above £500. This is the latest in a series of moves by the British government to increase taxes on gambling. In July, a new levy was introduced that raised the tax on online gambling winnings from 20% to 25%.</p>
<p>Critics say that the new tax will do more harm than good, and will discourage people from gambling. They argue that it will lead to an increase in black market gambling and cross-border betting. Others argue that the tax is necessary to protect consumers and ensure that they are not being taken advantage of by bookmakers.</p>
<p>The government says that the new tax is necessary to ensure that gambling is carried out fairly and responsibly. It also argues that the money raised will be used to help treat problem gamblers and support those who have been affected by gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="German-Gambling-Profits-taxable-at-25"><a href="#German-Gambling-Profits-taxable-at-25" class="headerlink" title="German Gambling Profits taxable at 25%"></a>German Gambling Profits taxable at 25%</h1><p>Germany is one of the countries in Europe that imposes a gambling tax. The tax is 25% on profits and it applies to all forms of gambling, including land-based and online casinos.</p>
<p>The decision to levy a gambling tax was made back in 2009 and it was aimed at preventing unlicensed operators from taking advantage of German players. This has been a successful policy, as there are now many licensed operators that contribute to the government’s coffers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are no restrictions on how much someone can lose while gambling – the losses are not tax-deductible. This is in contrast to other countries like the United States, where gambling losses can be used to offset taxable income.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the gambling tax are used to fund social programs, such as pensions and healthcare. This is a good thing, as it ensures that the money raised from the tax is put to good use.</p>
<p>There have been discussions about increasing the gambling tax in Germany, but no decisions have been made yet. It will be interesting to see whether or not this happens in the future, as it could lead to even more revenue for the government.</p>

        <h1 id="Tax-Rate-on-Gambling-Profits-to-Increase-in-Pennsylvania"><a href="#Tax-Rate-on-Gambling-Profits-to-Increase-in-Pennsylvania" class="headerlink" title="Tax Rate on Gambling Profits to Increase in Pennsylvania"></a>Tax Rate on Gambling Profits to Increase in Pennsylvania</h1><p>The Pennsylvania government is planning to implement a new gambling tax that will increase the tax rate on gambling profits. Governor Tom Wolf announced the plan in his budget proposal for the 2020-2021 fiscal year, which he presented to the state legislature on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The proposed tax would be applied to all types of gambling, including casino gaming, horse racing, and slot machines. It would increase the rate from its current level of 34% to 50%. This would be the first time that Pennsylvania has increased its gambling tax since 2004.</p>
<p>Governor Wolf said that the new tax is needed in order to help address the state’s $2 billion budget shortfall. He added that it would also generate an additional $100 million in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposed tax say that it will lead to job losses and closures at gaming facilities throughout Pennsylvania. They also argue that it will hurt tourism in the state. Supporters argue that the increased revenue from the tax will help fund important programs and services.</p>
<p>A vote on the proposed gambling tax is expected to take place in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Sin-Taxes-What-Are-the-Rates-for-Gambling-Booze-and-Cigarettes"><a href="#Sin-Taxes-What-Are-the-Rates-for-Gambling-Booze-and-Cigarettes" class="headerlink" title="Sin Taxes: What Are the Rates for Gambling, Booze and Cigarettes?"></a>Sin Taxes: What Are the Rates for Gambling, Booze and Cigarettes?</h1><p>As the debate over the Affordable Care Act raged on in Congress in 2009 and 2010, lawmakers also were working on a package of tax increases meant to pay for the health law. Buried inside that legislation was a sin tax increase on cigarettes, beer and wine, and gambling.</p>
<p>The taxes were designed to discourage people from smoking, drinking and gambling, while raising money for the government. The final bill increased the federal tax on cigarettes by 61 cents per pack, to $1.01 per pack. Taxes on beer went up 6 cents per 12-ounce can, or 17 cents per six-pack, and wine taxes rose by 25 cents per 750 milliliters bottle, or $3 per bottle. The new tax on gambling was tacked onto tickets for live or simulcast horse races and casino games such as blackjack, roulette and craps. It was set at 2 percent of the total amount wagered.</p>
<p>The taxes are collected by the Internal Revenue Service and distributed to the states based on how much each state collects in taxes on those products. States can use the money to support programs that discourage smoking, drinking and gambling, or they can put it into their general fund.</p>
<p>The sin tax rates have not changed since they were enacted in 2009. But there has been talk in Washington of increasing them as part of a larger effort to pay for President Donald Trump’s proposed infrastructure plan.</p>
<p>So what would be the new rates if Congress approved an infrastructure package that included a sin tax increase?</p>
<p>Cigarettes: A pack of cigarettes would cost $1.16 per pack if the sin tax increase was approved. That would be an increase of 15 cents per pack.</p>
<p>Beer: The tax on beer would go up 8 cents per 12-ounce can, or 24 cents per six-pack.</p>
<p>Wine: The tax on wine would go up 33 cents per 750 milliliters bottle, or $4 per bottle.</p>
<p>Gambling: The tax on gambling would go up 4 percent of the total amount wagered.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa’s-New-Gambling-Tax-Could-Generate-Millions"><a href="#Iowa’s-New-Gambling-Tax-Could-Generate-Millions" class="headerlink" title="Iowa’s New Gambling Tax Could Generate Millions"></a>Iowa’s New Gambling Tax Could Generate Millions</h1><p>Iowa lawmakers are considering a new gambling tax that would generate millions of dollars for the state. The proposed tax would be levied on casinos and racetracks, and would be the first such tax in the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of the proposed tax say it is needed to help offset budget shortfalls. The state is facing a projected $868 million budget shortfall for the next fiscal year, and officials say the new gambling tax could help close that gap.</p>
<p>Opponents of the tax say it will hurt the state’s gambling industry, which already faces competition from casinos in neighboring states. They also argue that the money generated by the tax could be better used to fund other government programs.</p>
<p>Whatever side of the issue you support, there is no doubt that Iowa’s new gambling tax could generate a lot of money for the state. With budgets tight nationwide, more and more states are turning to gambling taxes to help pay for government programs.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-of-My-Winnings-Are-Taxed"><a href="#How-Much-of-My-Winnings-Are-Taxed" class="headerlink" title="How Much of My Winnings Are Taxed?"></a>How Much of My Winnings Are Taxed?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there is one thing on everyone’s mind - taxes! How much of my winnings are taxed? This is a question that doesn’t have a straightforward answer, as it depends on a number of factors. In this article, we will take a look at those factors and help you determine how much of your gambling winnings are taxable.</p>
<p>The first factor that determines how much of your gambling winnings are taxable is the type of gambling you engage in. There are two types: casino games and lottery games. Winnings from casino games are fully taxable, while lottery winnings are only partially taxable. The second factor that determines how much of your gambling winnings are taxable is your country of residence. Each country has its own tax laws governing gambling winnings, so you will need to consult with an accountant or tax specialist in order to determine how much of your winnings are taxable in your specific case.</p>
<p>In general, however, most countries treat gambling winnings as regular income and tax them accordingly. This means that you will likely need to pay income tax, social security tax, and sometimes even estate taxes on any money you earn from gambling. There may be some exceptions for people who gamble occasionally or those who only earn a small amount of money from gambling, but in most cases the taxes will be owed on all of your winnings.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that these taxes apply not just to the money you earn from winning bets, but also to any bonuses or other perks you may receive from the casino or lottery operator. So if you receive a free hotel room or a free dinner at the casino as a reward for your winning streak, those too can be considered taxable income.</p>
<p>In short, while it is impossible to give a definitive answer on how much of your gambling winnings are taxed, it is safe to say that in most cases they will be treated as regular income and taxed accordingly. If you have any specific questions about the tax laws in your country or about how they apply to your individual case, be sure to consult with an accountant or tax specialist.</p>

<p>Slot machines | $853,735<br>Slot machines are still the predominant game type in Nevada casinos and account for the majority of gaming tax revenue. However, Table Games continue to grow in popularity and generated more tax revenue than Poker rooms in fiscal year 2017.</p>

He’s created a casino right in his garage, and the whole family is fighting over who gets to run it!</p>
<p>Marge is outraged at first, thinking that Homer is exploiting their loved ones. But after she sees how much money the casino is making, she changes her tune and starts scheming to take over control herself.</p>
<p>Bart and Lisa are just happy to be able to lose all their money in a safe and legal environment. And Milhouse is thrilled that he’s found a new place to cheat at poker.</p>
<p>The only one not taking part in the casino fun is Maggie, who’s busy counting her money and plotting her next move.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-night-at-the-Simpsons-household-proves-eventful"><a href="#Casino-night-at-the-Simpsons-household-proves-eventful" class="headerlink" title="Casino night at the Simpsons household proves eventful!"></a>Casino night at the Simpsons household proves eventful!</h1><p>The Springfielders are in for a night of casino fun, courtesy of Mr. Burns! He’s rented out a fancy casino and everyone’s invited - even the Flanders. But things quickly get out of hand, when Kearney starts cheating and Ned starts winning. Before long, tempers are flaring and fists are flying! Can the Simpsons put on their game faces and come out on top?</p>
<p>The night begins with everyone getting excited about hitting the casino. Even Bart is feeling lucky, and he’s not the only one! The Flanders go home with more money than they know what to do with, while Homer ends up losing big time.</p>
<p>But things quickly take a turn for the worse when Kearney starts cheating. Moe accuses him of using a marked deck of cards, and a fight breaks out. Soon everyone is taking part, including Lisa and Maggie! It’s every man - or woman - for themselves as they battle it out for supremacy at the casino tables.</p>
<p>In the end, the Simpsons come out on top. But it wasn’t easy! They had to use all their cunning and skills to win against some very tough competition. Will they be able to do it again next time? Only time will tell!</p>
<h1 id="Homer’s-casino-a-smashing-success"><a href="#Homer’s-casino-a-smashing-success" class="headerlink" title="Homer’s casino a smashing success!"></a>Homer’s casino a smashing success!</h1><p>Homer’s casino is a smashing success, as everyone in Springfield has been flooding through the doors to try their luck. The casino is a great place to gamble, with all sorts of games to choose from.</p>
<p>There are slot machines, poker, blackjack, and roulette tables, and even a miniature golf course on the premises. The slots are always popular, with people betting their hard-earned cash on the hope of hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p>The poker games are also always busy, as people compete for big prizes. There have been some huge wins at Homer’s casino, with people walking away with thousands of dollars. The blackjack and roulette tables are also getting a lot of action, as people try their luck with those games too.</p>
<p>There’s something for everyone at Homer’s casino, and it’s proving to be a huge hit with Springfield residents. If you’re looking for some excitement and want to try your luck at the casino games, then head on over to Homer’s and see what all the fuss is about!</p>
<h1 id="House-divided-Simpsons-fight-over-who-gets-to-keep-casino-profits"><a href="#House-divided-Simpsons-fight-over-who-gets-to-keep-casino-profits" class="headerlink" title="House divided: Simpsons fight over who gets to keep casino profits!"></a>House divided: Simpsons fight over who gets to keep casino profits!</h1><p>The Simpsons are no strangers to fighting, but their latest squabble may have taken things too far. The family is divided over who gets to keep the casino profits, with Homer and Bart at odds with each other.</p>
<p>Things came to a head when Bart discovered that his father had been pocketing money from the casino. Furious, he confronted Homer and a huge argument ensued. The two have been at loggerheads ever since, refusing to speak to each other.</p>
<p>Marge is caught in the middle of it all, and she’s not sure what to do. She doesn’t want her family to be torn apart, but she can’t stand the thought of Homer stealing from them.</p>
<p>The situation has gotten so bad that the family is now considering splitting up. Bart has already announced that he’s moving out, and Homer is threatening to leave too. Marge is desperately trying to find a way to reconcile them, but it’s looking increasingly unlikely that she’ll succeed.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that the Simpsons have fought over money. In fact, they seem to be pretty good at it! But this time it feels different – maybe because it could actually tear the family apart? Only time will tell…</p>
<h1 id="Simpsons-go-gambling-What-could-possibly-go-wrong"><a href="#Simpsons-go-gambling-What-could-possibly-go-wrong" class="headerlink" title="Simpsons go gambling: What could possibly go wrong?"></a>Simpsons go gambling: What could possibly go wrong?</h1><p>The Simpsons have always been known for pushing the envelope, and their latest foray into the world of gambling is no exception. In a recent episode, they headed to a casino in order to try their luck at the tables.</p>
<p>Of course, as with most things that the Simpsons do, things did not go quite as planned. Homer ended up losing all of their money, and Bart ended up getting caught cheating.</p>
<p>Needless to say, things quickly went downhill from there. Bart was arrested and ended up in jail, while Homer had to frantically find a way to come up with the money to bail him out.</p>
<p>This episode is a perfect example of why gambling can be so risky. It’s all too easy to lose track of what you’re doing and end up in over your head.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about giving gambling a try, be sure to keep this episode in mind. It’s a cautionary tale that is sure to steer you away from making some of the same mistakes that the Simpsons made.</p>

        <h1 id="Marseille-to-test-players-for-cocaine"><a href="#Marseille-to-test-players-for-cocaine" class="headerlink" title="Marseille to test players for cocaine"></a>Marseille to test players for cocaine</h1><p>Football Clubs in Marseille will test their players for cocaine after two of their players tested positive for the drug.</p>
<p>Striker Clinton Njie and midfielder Andre Zambo Anguissa both failed drugs tests after a French Cup match against lower-league side Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien.</p>
<p>Marseille announced on Wednesday that they will now test all of their players for cocaine, as well as other banned substances.</p>
<p>The Ligue 1 club released a statement which read: “Olympique de Marseille confirms that, following the positive result for cocaine of two of its players in a control carried out after the match against Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien (French Cup) on January 8, 2018, it has decided to test all its players for this substance and others prohibited.”</p>
<p>Njie and Anguissa are now set to be provisionally suspended from playing by the French Football Federation (FFF). This is not the first time that Njie has been caught up in a controversy involving drugs - he was banned from international football for six months in 2016 after testing positive for cannabis.</p>
<h1 id="Drug-test-for-Marseille-players-proves-positive"><a href="#Drug-test-for-Marseille-players-proves-positive" class="headerlink" title="Drug test for Marseille players proves positive"></a>Drug test for Marseille players proves positive</h1><p>Reports in the French media this morning are suggesting that a number of Marseille first team players have failed drug tests. The news comes just days after the club’s Champions League elimination at the hands of RB Leipzig, and is said to be a major blow to their hopes of reclaiming the Ligue 1 title from Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>The testing was allegedly carried out ahead of the club’s clash with Leipzig, with several key stars found to have traces of cocaine in their systems. Among those said to have tested positive are Florian Thauvin, Lucas Ocampos and Dimitri Payet.</p>
<p>Marseille have yet to comment on the reports, but they are expected to release a statement later today. The news is another blow for Marseille after a disappointing season which has seen them knocked out of both domestic cup competitions and fall well behind PSG in the league table.</p>
<p>It is not clear at this stage what sanctions - if any - will be imposed on the players involved. However, it is likely that they will be hit with lengthy bans from competitive football.</p>
<h1 id="Marseille-to-take-legal-action-against-drug-testers"><a href="#Marseille-to-take-legal-action-against-drug-testers" class="headerlink" title="Marseille to take legal action against drug testers"></a>Marseille to take legal action against drug testers</h1><p>The mayor of Marseille has announced that the city will take legal action against drug testers after the latest round of tests were said to have caused “significant disruption” to the daily lives of residents. The announcement comes after a group of around 50 people gathered outside City Hall on Monday to protest the recent tests, which they say are “harassment”.</p>
<p>“The pointless and indiscriminate nature of these tests is causing significant disruption to the daily lives of our citizens,” said Mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin in a statement. “It is now time for us to take legal action.”</p>
<p>The mayor’s office has not yet announced what form this legal action will take, but it is believed that the city could file a lawsuit against the French Agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), which is responsible for organising the tests. Marseille is just one of many French cities that have been targeted by ANSM in recent months as part of a nationwide crackdown on drugs.</p>
<p>Residents of Marseille have voiced their anger over the tests, which they say are causing undue stress and anxiety. Many feel that they are being unfairly targeted, and that the tests are not actually doing anything to improve public safety. “These tests are nothing more than intimidation tactics,” said Farid Boussaid, a local resident who took part in Monday’s protest. “They’re just making our lives more difficult.”</p>
<p>Others argue that the tests are simply a waste of time and money. “What’s the point?” said Mokhtar Achouri, another local resident. “We all know that there’s drugs in this city, so what good are these tests going to do?”</p>
<h1 id="UEFA-orders-drug-test-for-all-clubs-in-Champions-League"><a href="#UEFA-orders-drug-test-for-all-clubs-in-Champions-League" class="headerlink" title="UEFA orders drug test for all clubs in Champions League"></a>UEFA orders drug test for all clubs in Champions League</h1><p>In an effort to improve the image of UEFA and its Champions League, the organization has announced that it will order drug tests for all clubs taking part in the tournament. The move comes after several high-profile cases of doping in football in recent years.</p>
<p>UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said that the decision was made in light of “the negative perception of our sport in some circles.” He added that “the goal is to have a level playing field for all clubs.”</p>
<p>Drug testing for athletes is common in many sports, but it is relatively new to football. In 2016, UEFA ordered its first random drug tests on players in the Champions League and Europa League. The tests revealed that about 1 percent of players had traces of prohibited substances in their system.</p>
<p>Ceferin said that the new policy will be implemented immediately and apply to all teams in the Champions League, including those that have been eliminated from the tournament. He added that UEFA will also work with national associations to ensure that drug testing is carried out at all levels of football.</p>
<p>The announcement was welcomed by anti-doping officials, who have long called for increased testing in football. “This is a very significant step forward,” said Jonathan Taylor, executive director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). “It demonstrates a clear commitment by UEFA to protecting the integrity of its competitions.”</p>
<p> Drug testing has become an important issue in football following several high-profile cases of doping in recent years. In 2015, seven players from Turkish club Galatasaray were suspended after failing a drug test. In 2016, two Spanish clubs – Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid – were fined after their players tested positive for cocaine.</p>
<p>In 2017, six Russian players from FC Rostov were embroiled in a doping scandal after they failed a drugs test following a match against Monaco. The players were found to have traces of meldonium in their system, which is known to increase endurance and help with recovery times.</p>
<h1 id="Drug-tests-on-Marseille-players-Didier-Deschamps-defends-decision"><a href="#Drug-tests-on-Marseille-players-Didier-Deschamps-defends-decision" class="headerlink" title="Drug tests on Marseille players: Didier Deschamps defends decision"></a>Drug tests on Marseille players: Didier Deschamps defends decision</h1><p>On Tuesday, 3 October, Didier Deschamps, coach of the French national football team, announced that he would be conducting drug tests on all 23 players in his squad ahead of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus. This announcement was met with criticism from some members of the media and public, who argue that it is an invasion of privacy. However, Deschamps has defended his decision, insisting that it is necessary in order to ensure that his players are fully focused on the task at hand.</p>
<p>It is not the first time that drug tests have been carried out on French footballers in advance of a major tournament. In 1998, when the team went on to win the World Cup, all 22 players were tested prior to their semi-final against Croatia. At that time, there was much speculation about whether superstar striker Zinedine Zidane had taken performance-enhancing drugs, but these allegations were never proven.</p>
<p>This latest move by Deschamps has been criticised by some as a mere publicity stunt designed to deflect attention away from reports of unrest within the squad. However, the coach has denied this, saying: “I AM NOT LOOKING FOR EXCUSES. I did this before Euro 2016 and people said it was because there were problems in the camp.”</p>
<p>The drug tests will take place at Clairefontaine, France’s national football training centre, later this week.</p>
